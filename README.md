A Code Editor with syntax highlighting from Scratch made in HTML, CSS and Javascript
Highlighting is regex-based for now
I am working on making a custom C++ lexer and parser in JS and highlighting everything from there
Supports C++ syntax for now

## Known Bugs
- Backspacing on an empty line moves the caret to the end of the line above. Reproducible without any effort.
- Sometimes pasting code causes extra empty lines in between across the whole code. No guaranteed steps known to reproduce as of now.

Care to fix? I accept contributors.
