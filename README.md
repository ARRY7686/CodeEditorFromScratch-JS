A Code Editor with syntax highlighting from Scratch made in HTML, CSS and Javascript
Highlighting is regex-based for now
I am working on making a custom C++ lexer and parser in JS and highlighting everything from there
Supports C++ syntax for now

(Note: Might behave unexpectedly when pressing backspace on an empty line)
